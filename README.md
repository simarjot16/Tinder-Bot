# Tinder-Bot
Let's automate the boring stuff of right swiping your date and jump to the interesting stuff of chatting with them.

Ever been irritated by people telling you that programming stops you from getting to know others. With this bot, programming might help you socialize even more than you can. And you know the fun part, you do not need extra hardware for this or even complex codes, it is as simple as writing a code for "Hello World!", obviously once you know how to do it.

The bot is entirely coded in Python and depends on presence of Selenium and chrome webdriver installed in your system.

In first few lines we have initialised the driver and proceeded further. After that the program tries to open Tinder's website on successful completion of which the sign in with facebook option is selected and predefined credentials are put in. To determine each element we have made the use of its xpath.

all the exceptions such as coming up of new window and opening of window after a successful match has been taken into consideration.

I hope this works well on your system too yet in case of any query, you can contact me at: singh.16.simarjot@gmail.com

Happy Coding!!
